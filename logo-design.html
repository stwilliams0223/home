					  		<h2>Huston Hearing Care &amp; Audiology Logo</h2>
						<p>The logo mark is supposed to mimic sounds waves being heard by ears.  A monochromatic color schemes of purple was used to allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention.  The hearing text in the logo was bolded in purple so people looking at the logo would know what the company does.

					  	<h2>Hearing Aid Buyer's Guide Logo</h2>
						<p>The logo mark is supposed to mimic sound waves circling into an ear.  The use of a rounded typeface in all lowercase was meant to make the website feel friendly, yet still remain professional with it's clean look and entire color palette of blue, grey, white and orange.

					  	<h2>Voizecandy Logo</h2>
						<p>This company is a music company that teaches people how to sing and market themselves.  The color pallete of pink and black was chosen by owner, but I decided to add a monochramtic solor scheme to the pink to add some depth to the icon so that it wasn't as 2D but still remained flat.  The idea was to accentuate the letter 'z' into a jagged soundwave to mimic sound.</p>

					  	<h2>My Personal Logo</h2>
						<p>This is a logo that I made for me personally.  The idea was to combine my intials within one single icon that more resembles a 'W' which stands for my last name, Williams.  I also wanted to remeble a 'hang loose' hand gesture to coincide with my belief that it's in my control to make sure everything will be OK and to relax. </p>

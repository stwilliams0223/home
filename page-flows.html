					  		<h2>Huston Hearing Care &amp; Audiology Website</h2>
						<p>I designed Huston Hearing's website with Wordpress and created 100% of the content.  I was able to implement the entire design and user experience process for the site.  Starting at the research and interview process, to sketches and wireframing, to information architecture and page flows, and then finally to the final design.

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Promotional Materials</h2>
						<p>This is a decibel chart designed to grab attention and give information to the viewer.  The original purpose was to print this very large in scale to be used as a 'floor mat' to grab attention from people at trade shows.  It proved to be a very successful way to bring people into the booth to talk more about the products.</p>

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Promotional Materials</h2>
						<p>This is a 18x24 poster.  This poster was designed to show current patients why Huston Hearing stand out from its competitors.  The idea in the design was to put Huston Hearing's strengths in the middle of the page, while also giving the their column some contrast from the rest to bring focus to why Huston Hearing beleives it outmatches its competitors.</p>

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Promotional Materials</h2>
						<p>This is 18x24 poster.  This poster was designed to visually show the different lifestyle classes that any given person may have.  The purpose of the design was to allow the hearing healthcare professional to see which lifestyle best matched the patient's and to show them how hearing aids can 'upgrade' their current lifestyle from one up to another.</p>

					  	<h2>Huston Hearing Brochure</h2>
						<p>This is a two-sided brochure.  This brochure was designed with a clean and simple grid look to convey to the reader that Huston Hearing is a professional company that is clean and serious about taking care of its patients.  All future brochures were designed in this format and look to keep brand unity.</p>
